# ProBord: **Pro**virus **Bord**er Delimiter
ProBord (**Pro**virus **Bord**er Delimiter) is a bioinformatics tool that predicts the precise borders of proviruses by identifying attL/R sites.

# Introduction
## 1. Prophage integration process

A prophage usually refers to a virus integrated into a prokaryotic chromosome as a stable genetic element. Before integration, the phage attP site and the host attB site—share core sequence—undergo site-specific recombination catalyzed by integrase (Int), producing attL and attR sites flanking the prophage in the host genome. During excision, attL and attR recombine in reverse, mediated by integrase and excisionase (Xis), restoring attP on the free phage DNA and attB on the host chromosome. Unless otherwise stated, attB, attP, and attL/R refer to their core sequences.
